            <strong>What we do - Our Services</strong>
            <p>
              The VidTrial service is designed to promote your YouTube channel
              videos using the Google Ads network. Promotion packages start from
              $100 or â‚¬93. VAT is applicable if you live in an EU country.
            </p>
            <p>
              VidTrial guarantees generating views from Google Ad campaigns.
              Your views estimate is the minimum number you will receive as
              determined by the budget and length of promotion.
            </p>
            <p>
              VidTrial does not guarantee the number for interactions, such as
              new subscribers, likes, and comments.
            </p>
            <p>
              The promotion takes place on YouTube using their In-feed Video Ads
              (Discovery Ads) and TrueView In-Stream Ads.
            </p>

            <strong>When do promotions start</strong>
            <p>
              Ad promotions begin after at least one of your YouTube videos have
              passed the Google review process; this usually takes up to 48
              hours, and can sometimes take longer based on Google's review
              process. It primarily depends on the content and the targeting
              chosen. You can always contact us to get updates on the review
              process and what to do for future review processes.
            </p>

            <strong>How long are promotions executed</strong>
            <p>
              Generally, your promotion is executed for 6-8 days. Based on
              metrics, sometimes promotions are executed for longer intervals.
              The timeline for promotions depends on the targeting settings and
              content. Exact length of the promotions cannot be guaranteed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Types of Targeting that can be chosen</strong>
            <p>
              You can set the targeting for your entire promotion, before &
              during the promotion. Targeting can be set by country, age,
              gender, and interests. In case you are not sure, we will do it for
              you before starting your promotion. We guarantee you that we never
              change the targeting you chose for countries, age, and gender.
            </p>
            <p>
              The targeting can be adjusted by interests to make your promotion
              perform better.
            </p>
            <p>
              We set the targeting for promotions by default and change it
              during the promotion if you choose automatic targeting.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Video selection</strong>
            <p>
              You can select the videos for your promotion manually, or we can
              choose them automatically. You can always add new videos to your
              promotion from your VidTrial dashboard.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can select all future videos from your channel to be added
              automatically to your promotion. You can turn this option on when
              creating your promotion or choose it later in your VidTrial
              dashboard.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Google ads review process</strong>
            <p>
              We can't influence the Google review process in any way. We can
              only make sure that your ads don't violate Google Ads policies.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a possibility that not all of your videos will pass the
              Google review. When this happens, we will only promote the videos
              that have passed the Google review.
